This repository contains files connected with developing master's thesis project. 

### Current status
Now repository consists of 3 folders: datasets, latex and literature sources.
- datasets folder - contains ultrasound images found in the Internet (open-source datasets), as well as images recorded as part of research for the project on the Mindray UMT-500Plus device. For this purpose, the following heads were used: linear L12-3s and convex C5-1s.
- latex folder - contains the entire LaTeX format files used to generate the document with the thesis. Document is being written using TeXstudio and MiKTeX software.
- literature sources folder - contains pdf files with articles that will be cited in the thesis. In the folder, there is also a created bib file with all BibTeX references.

### Future development of repository
A directory containing the project's source code will be added in the future. It will be created using Python and / or Matlab.
