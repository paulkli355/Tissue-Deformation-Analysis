# Master's thesis repository
## Tissue deformation analysis in ultrasound images
author: Paulina Klimanek

## Project goal
The subject of the project is the development and implementation of a methodology for mapping deformation changes in soft tissues in ultrasound examinations (strain elastography). It is assumed that the developed method will use the tracking of image features in the sequence of ultrasound images during tissue compression.

This repository contains files connected with developing master's thesis project. 

### Current status
Now repository consists of 3 folders: *datasets*, *latex* and *literature sources*.
- *datasets* folder - contains ultrasound images found in the Internet (open-source datasets), as well as images recorded as part of research for the project on the Mindray UMT-500Plus device. For this purpose, the following heads were used: linear L12-3s and convex C5-1s.
- *latex* folder - contains the entire LaTeX format files used to generate the document with the thesis. Document is being written using TeXstudio and MiKTeX software.
- *literature sources* folder - contains pdf files with articles that will be cited in the thesis. In the folder, there is also a created bib file with all BibTeX references.

### Future development of repository
A directory containing the project's source code will be added in the future. It will be created using Python and / or Matlab.
